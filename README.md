# Restroom Chat
## Concept
This app is a unique concept that brings the age-old tradition of drawing and writing on toilet walls into the digital world. The app is designed to work with Bluetooth, making it completely connectionless, and users can send messages through Bluetooth advertising. The app is perfect for those who want to express themselves creatively, without the fear of being judged.

One of the most exciting features of our app is the drawing pad, which allows users to create their own art and express themselves in a fun and unique way. Additionally, users can take pictures with their camera and directly send them to the chat. If you want to send images or drawings, you'll need an internet connection because they are hosted in an image hosting API.

The app has different chat rooms, which each represent Bluetooth beacons and are designed to mimic different bars. The idea is to make this app a unique and fun way for bar-goers to communicate with each other while in the restroom. The colors of the texts and drawings vary, just like on a toilet wall, and the chat bubbles and font colors change every time the chat is refreshed or scrolled.

We hope you'll enjoy our Restroom Chat App as much as we do. It's a fun and creative way to express yourself and communicate with others in an exciting way. 

## How to use?
- Clone the project, open in Android Studio and run the code.
- Open the app and grant the necessary permissions (bluetooth, camera, etc.).
- To access the chat rooms, click on the "Start" button on the main screen.
- Select the chat room you want to join. For testing purposes, we have created two chat rooms that do not require physical beacons. Simply select "Chat 1" or "Chat 2".
- Once you've joined a chat room, you can start chatting and drawing with others in the room. To send a message, simply type your message into the text box and hit "send". To draw, click on the drawing pad icon, and start creating your masterpiece. If you want to send a picture, click on the camera icon, and take a picture.
- Remember, for sending pictures or drawings, you will need a working internet connection as they are hosted in an image hosting API.
